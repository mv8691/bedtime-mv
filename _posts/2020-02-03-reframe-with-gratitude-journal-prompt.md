This track of journal prompts is designed to help you reflect on the experiences from your day and reframe with gratitude. Creating space for reflection, and understanding that it is only a label assigned by our mind that frames something as good or bad. We have the power to reassign any negative labels, and acknowledge the opportunities for growth by finding the upside in the experience.
